# innomaticsInternshipTask1
A Personal Budget Tracker built using pure HTML as part of my Full Stack Internship at Innomatics. It allows users to add, categorize, edit, and delete income &amp; expenses, displaying them in a structured table. This project strengthens HTML fundamentals, form handling, and semantic structuring. ðŸš€ #WebDevelopment #HTML #BudgetTracker
